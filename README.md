# Project Overview
This repository contains my latest machine learning project, where I focused on understanding and building a model to generate new names based on patterns in a unique list of names. Throughout this project, I encountered and resolved many challenges, which helped clarify my understanding and improve my skills.

## Key Features and Learning Outcomes
### Character-Level Pattern Learning and Generation

This model takes a list of unique names, learns character-level patterns, and generates new names based on these patterns. Using a probabilistic approach, I gained insights into how tokenization works at a basic level and how to use character-level probabilities effectively.
### Optimization and Avoiding Dead Neurons

I explored different optimization techniques, focusing on initialization strategies and training processes. I learned the importance of monitoring and managing dead neurons, which can arise due to activation functions.
## Next Steps
Looking ahead, my goals are to:

Deepen my understanding of backpropagation, aiming to apply it on a larger scale.
Explore advanced tokenization systems to support different languages, symbols, and code.
Progress toward building a model inspired by GPT-1 architecture.
